# Renardo interface for Pulsar

See [Renardo's repository](https://github.com/e-lie/renardo) for installation and usage instructions.

It basically works like the native interface, with some extras:

- Multiple cursors are executed in order of creation.
- Can evaluate the entire file.
- Autocompletion.

## Start livecoding

This only works in the scope of python files.

**Toggle Renardo** (`ctrl-alt-f`) in order to start it.
